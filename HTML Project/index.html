      <p>A singer is a vocal artist who uses their voice as a musical instrument to produce melody, harmony, and rhythm. Singers have the ability to convey a wide range of emotions through their vocal expression, making them central figures in the world of music. Their skill lies not only in their vocal technique, including pitch, tone, and range, but also in their capacity to interpret lyrics and connect with an audience on an emotional level.</p>

        <p>One common workplace for singers is the stage. Whether performing in a musical theater production, a concert tour, or a local gig, the stage is where singers showcase their talent and connect with their audience. Onstage, singers must project their voice and express themselves through movement, facial expressions, and stage presence. The stage can be a thrilling but also nerve-wracking environment, as performers must often deal with stage fright and the pressure of live performance. </p>
