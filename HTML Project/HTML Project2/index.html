    <p>A full-stack developer is expected to be able to work in all the layers of the application (front-end and back-end). A full-stack developer can be defined as a developer or an engineer who works with both the front and back end development of a website, web application or desktop application. This means they can lead platform builds that involve databases, user-facing websites, and working with clients during the planning phase of projects.</p>
    <p>
        A full-stack developer does a lot of different tasks using different skills. On the front-end, they craft user interfaces, ensuring a seamless user experience. This involves using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks like React and Angular. On the back-end, they handle server-side logic, databases, and server configuration using technologies like Node.js, Python, Ruby, or PHP.

    <h2>Lets Divide Full full-stack into 3 Parts</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Front End</li>
        <li>Back End</li>
        <li>Database</li>
    </ul>
